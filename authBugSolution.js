A more robust approach involves debouncing the listener's response.  Instead of directly reacting to every change, we introduce a delay to ensure only the most recent state change is processed.

```javascript
let authTimeout;
firebase.auth().onAuthStateChanged(user => {
  clearTimeout(authTimeout);
  authTimeout = setTimeout(() => {
    if (user) {
      // User is signed in
    } else {
      // User is signed out
    }
  }, 100); // Adjust delay as needed
});
```

This solution uses `setTimeout` to create a delay.  The `clearTimeout` call ensures that any pending timeout is cleared before a new one is set, preventing multiple delayed executions. The 100ms delay is adjustable; you might need to fine-tune it based on your application's specific requirements.  Consider also adding more sophisticated error handling and logging for better monitoring in production environments.
