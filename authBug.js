The Firebase SDK's `onAuthStateChanged` listener might not trigger as expected if the user's authentication state changes rapidly (e.g., due to frequent sign-in/sign-out attempts or network instability).  This can lead to missed updates and unexpected behavior in your app.  The listener might be overwhelmed and drop events.

```javascript
firebase.auth().onAuthStateChanged(user => {
  if (user) {
    // User is signed in
  } else {
    // User is signed out
  }
});
```
